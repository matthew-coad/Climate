VicRainFall
----------------------------------------------------

One of the first data analysis I did in R.

The idea why was to try to produce a video of changes in
rainfall in my home state of Victoria.

Utilitimately it didn't really work as a visualization. But was a valuable
exercise.

Right now not working on my system because one of the packages
I originally used is no longer compatible with the latest version R.

Keeping it round because it was a bit cute and contains some useful code 
climate related data sources.
