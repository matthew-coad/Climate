# Discovering Climate Change Series

This is the source for my Climate Change Data analysis series. Anyone is free to download any part and use it any way. 
If you wish to use it some acknowledgement would be nice.

It contains all the code and reports that form the project. It also contains all the data file except the detailed Australia data, which is
excluded because it runs at about a Gig compressed!

The code to download the Australian data from the BOM website is included but it takes a *long* time to run, like days, and tends to 
retried a few times because bits of it had network issues. If anyone is interested drop me a line and I'll see what you can do to get 
a hold of it.
